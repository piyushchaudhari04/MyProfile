				                                                                                  First Phase<br>
There was a Village named taloda in nadurbar district  there lived a boy.The name of the boy was prem.due to the good economical condition of their family he was put to study in hostel since childhood to pune.As been studying in a good environment he used studied hard and become a good engineering earning high amount of money.
  Then started the topic of his marriage in the village so his parents found a beautiful girl for prem  the girl belonged to a neraby village named dhule.she was very beautiful but as being grown in the village she was a typical village girl.like marriage was a sacred vow for them its a pure relationship between a husband and a wife.
The girls in the villages are grown up by their parents teaching them that husband is like a god to them they must always respect their husbands .never argue with them   always be as a obedient wife always take care of your husband .So being a village girl the girl was very frightened regarding how her husband will be,now she will have to go in service for him.she would have to treat her husband as a god.But ultimately the day of marriage came and the marriage was like a diwali festival in the village.Everyone were very happy specially the mother of the girl beacause her burden was reduced
I dont know why girls are burden to their parents and not the boy.if in future i am lucky and i get blessed by a baby girl it would be the happiest moment for me.So then continuing to the marriage it ended very well and then came the bidai section and the girl and their family members cried a lot and the boy was having a feeling like are they happy with the marriage or are they sad he was happy on the other side because he was married to one of the most beautiful girl.

                                                                                     <br>Second Phase<br>

The bride and the bridegroom bot reached at their house.And as it was the honeymoon night and special preparations were made in their bedroom.
As usual the bride was sent in with the a glass of milk.her situation was very critical she was frightened dont know what to do then she went towards the bed and sat on the bed till then every thing was mum between them he was looking at his beautiful wife and she was looking down totally frightened.Then he understood the situation and he broke the mum and spoke the first word "I am very happy that i got a wife like you."
This words brought a smile on her face.Then she spoke her first word "I dont know anything about todays night " .Then spoke the engineer and said see i have married you  to make my wife my life partner and you are not a call girl  so todays day is special only for the reason that todays the day when we got married.and unless we dont know each other and fall in love with each other we will not celebrate our honeymoon.By hearing this she was shocked because she had heard different things in her mind taught by her parents. her husbands these words impressed her and brought a satisfied smile on her face.
The next morning sun light fall on her face when she woke she saw that it was him who opened the courtens of the window to wake her up and in his hands was a tray having two cups which had coffee in it and she was like what is this happening how can a husband prepare a tea for a wife.But there was always a smile of satisfaction in her face.And she started falling in love with him.Then she asked him that why did he make this tea it was her duty to make tea?.Then he answered that between husband and wife nothing is no ones duty husband and wife live with each other and for each other.They care for each other and they cant live without each other.There are no duties specified to a particular person.And when she heard this a small drop of water fell from her eyes through her cheeks down the ground.And a soft smile on her face.which made her husband feel very happy.Sorry the girls name is nisha.nisha had a dream to become a writer she wanted to write some good things and needed a support but she was frightened.But she took a chance and told prem about this and when he herad this he was like very happy he immediately hugged his wife this was the first time he touched his wife and nisha felt like she was in protected arms.He told her that he will support her in anyway he can and he would be very happy to see his wife become a writer.And he told that she would give her first autograph to him.That day she noted the date because she totally fell in love with him and she felt that her life is totally different than that her parents had fed in her mind.She though that she was the luckiest girl in the world.And after 1 year she had become a famous writer and also a mother of a cute baby girl.When the girl was born she spoke on sentence with the baby that when all men will be like your father no girl in this world would be a burden to their Parents.
