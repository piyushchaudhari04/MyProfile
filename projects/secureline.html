              Motivation:
                <br><br>

          1)Now a days student and alumni communication is very important and geting in contact through facebook 
		  has become very difficult and also all the students are not benifitted from it.So we need to devise some strategy to overcome this problem
		  in an innovative way.
          <br>
          2)There  is  need  of  software  which  is  easy  to  use  and  efficient  and  also 
			makes communication easily.
          <br>
          3)It will bind the pass out sttudents of the college to the college from where-ever they are.
